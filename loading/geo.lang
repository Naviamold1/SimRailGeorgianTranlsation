Random_Rim=Most rail vehicles use wheels consisting of two parts. The proper wheel (which is located in the middle) and the replaceable rim. This is to reduce operating costs - when worn, only the rim is replaced, not the entire wheel. The white stripes make it possible to detect rim misalignment, which is very dangerous and requires the vehicle to be immobilized immediately.
Random_LineNumber1_1=The railway line No. 1 available in SimRail is part of the historic Warsaw-Vienna Railway, which was the first railway line in today's Poland. It was established in 1845 and connected Warsaw with the border of the Austrian partition (Galicia).
